## Why I made this website

First of all, I didn't **make** this website.  
It's a fork of the relatively popular [hugo-monochrome](https://github.com/kaiiiz/hugo-theme-monochrome/)
theme that I'm hacking on. It's a really well designed theme that has all the features I need for a
simple blog/projects/misc website. I'm hosting it on Github Pages because it's free and convenient.
I'm not planning on making posts daily, weekly or even monthly. This website is for writing down my
thoughts, posting interesting stuff that I learned and maybe cringy attempts at trying to teach
people how to do various stuff.

## A little about me

At the time of writing this, I'm still a student working my way through college. Not having too much
trouble with that. I like to keep busy with interesting side projects that range from making a super
portable shell-script program that works as a mini notes program that stores notes in yet another
shell-script, to a TUI program written in [go](https://go.dev/) that helps you keep track on shows that
you watched.
