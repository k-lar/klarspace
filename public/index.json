It\u0026rsquo;s a really well designed theme that has all the features I need for a simple blog/projects/misc website. I\u0026rsquo;m hosting it on Github Pages because it\u0026rsquo;s free and convenient. I\u0026rsquo;m not planning on making posts daily, weekly or even monthly. This website is for writing down my thoughts, posting interesting stuff that I learned and maybe cringy attempts at trying to teach people how to do various stuff.\nA little about me At the time of writing this, I\u0026rsquo;m still a student working my way through college. Not having too much trouble with that. I like to keep busy with interesting side projects that range from making a super portable shell-script program that works as a mini notes program that stores notes in yet another shell-script, to a TUI program written in go that helps you keep track on shows that you watched.\n","permalink":"https://blog.k-lar.net/blog/first_post/","title":"First post"},{"content":" GNU/Linux copypasta I\u0026rsquo;d just like to interject for a moment. What you\u0026rsquo;re refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I\u0026rsquo;ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\nMany computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\nThere really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine\u0026rsquo;s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!\n","permalink":"https://blog.k-lar.net/misc/linux_copypasta/","title":"Linux copypasta"},{"content":" My links: Github Gitlab Cool websites: lofi.cafe Free vector images websites: undraw.co reshot.com lukaszadam.com/illustrations All images here use a free licence (MIT-ish) ","permalink":"https://blog.k-lar.net/me/links/","title":"My links"},{"content":" My pale gruvbox variation Here you can find my own gruvbox colorscheme variation. It\u0026rsquo;s a fork of gruvbox-flat.nvim, which is a fork of onedark.nvim. It gave me a good starting point in creating my own colorscheme with full TreeSitter support and fallback regex-based syntax highlighting in neovim.\nWhy this exists It\u0026rsquo;s a really dumb story.\nI started using vim/neovim in mid-to-late 2019. It was annoying and cumbersome to relearn all \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; editor keybindings like CTRL-a, CTRL-s and much more and replace them with this weird arcane \u0026ldquo;modal\u0026rdquo; system that my brain had to get used to. But I stuck to it. A big part of me sticking to it was my colorscheme of choice: gruvbox. It really felt like I found the perfect colorscheme, everything looked great and even if I was not having fun learning how to vim, at least I got to look at some pretty colors while I was struggling.\nWhat I didn\u0026rsquo;t know at the time, was that I configured my vim wrong and by extension, configured gruvbox wrong. Yes the default colors were gone and it looked much better, but what I ended up using for 3-4 years wasn\u0026rsquo;t the normal gruvbox everyone else is used to. I got the \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo; version because I did not set a variable in my .vimrc:\nset termguicolors After I realized my mistake, it was already too late. My eyes got way too used to this broken version of gruvbox that I thought the original version looked very out of place. That caused a lot of pain and wasted time when I tried to rice my dotfiles, and every time I tried applying a pre-made gruvbox config, everything felt out of place and I had to look up my colors with xcolor and apply them myself.\nI got tired of this weird process of taking gruvbox themes, \u0026ldquo;fixing\u0026rdquo; them and saving that configuration somewhere. That\u0026rsquo;s why I decided that it\u0026rsquo;s finally time to create my own colorscheme theme for neovim and more configurations are planned. Unlike the old gruvbox plugin for vim, mine and all the previous forks support TreeSitter syntax highlighting which all the cool new kids use these days (and for good reason).\nLualine theme Before I made the plugin for the whole colorscheme, I made a smaller plugin that\u0026rsquo;s a theme for lualine. It\u0026rsquo;s a port of the (again) broken version of an older status line plugin called lightline, where gruvbox set it\u0026rsquo;s own colorscheme. Since I got used to that bar looking a certain way, I kept the \u0026ldquo;broken\u0026rdquo; colors and ported it to the newer and more performant lua-based lualine.\nSome more example photos: Using Fzf-lua plugin for nvim: How a golang file looks: ","permalink":"https://blog.k-lar.net/projects/gruvbox_pale/","title":"My nvim colorscheme: gruvbox-pale"}]
